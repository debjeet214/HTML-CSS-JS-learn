CSS = Cascading Style sheets . (markup = html)
css basically helps in the styling of the webpage. and it makes the webpage looks good and interactive.

CSS TYPE
1. inline CSS   = written inside the indivisual tags using stylew attribute
2. internal CSS = written in a sepage section inside the html code in head section with Style tag
3. External CSS = written in a separate .css file outside html code & link the file with link tag in head
********************************************************************
CSS code always apply the style which is written at the last
like you written the same styling properties with different value through inline , internal & external way
it gives preference to the 1. inline , whichever written last it will be implemented.

* if you add !important tag after a styleing property then it will always get most presidence & can't be overwrite

            background-color: aqua;
            color:rgb(52, 97, 180) !important;
