CSS = Cascading Style sheets . (markup = html)
css basically helps in the styling of the webpage. and it makes the webpage looks good and interactive.

CSS TYPE
1. inline CSS   = written inside the indivisual tags using stylew attribute
2. internal CSS = written in a sepage section inside the html code in head section with Style tag
3. External CSS = written in a separate .css file outside html code & link the file with link tag in head
********************************************************************
CSS code always apply the style which is written at the last
like you written the same styling properties with different value through inline , internal & external way
it gives preference to the 1. inline , whichever written last it will be implemented.

* if you add !important tag after a styleing property then it will always get most presidence & can't be overwrite 
 <style>
        p{
            width: 60%;
            background-color: aqua;
            color:rgb(52, 97, 180) !important; **
        }

SELECTORS : those which help to tell the css which targeted html tag to style
1. element selector : p{}  telling p tag to style 

2. universal selector : *{}  means, you want to style all the tags in a 
same way ex. you want the font to be same and change so it is a easy way.

3. id selector : #xlx {}  to target specific tag id to change, there can be mitiple p tag, now if you use element selector it will change all the p tags, but to specifically target one p tag, just give it a id and use id selector to change it's styling only 

4. class selector : .xlx{} this is class selector, it can be applied to all the P tags with the class xlx to change it's style. 

***the ID selector is applied only to one element in a page, whereas the class selector can be applied to several elements on a single page.***


Type of Font in CSS
1. web safe fornt : This fonts that are pre downloaded in the machine 
2.  web font : those that need to take from web and link it in the cose. <link href = >

there is many things to not study at first but you will know about it later while coding more in the future in the projects.
