Data types in js:

In JavaScript, we have some standard pre-defined datatypes. There are seven types of data types that can be divided into two main categories, which are given below:
1. Primitive and 2. Non-primitive

   * primitive data type:
1. numbers : it can be integer, decimal, float, double etc.
2.  srtring : line of words
3.  boolean : true or false (1 or 0)
4.  NULL: This data type represents the absence of any value. It is represented by the keyword null(without any quotes).
5.  Undefined: This data type also represents the absence of a value, if any variable is not assigned any value,
 it has an undefined value. It is denoted by the keyword undefined. This is not the same as null.
