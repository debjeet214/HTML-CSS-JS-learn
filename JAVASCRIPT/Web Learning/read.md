Data types in js:

In JavaScript, we have some standard pre-defined datatypes. There are seven types of data types that can be divided into two main categories, which are given below: Primitive and Non-primitive

* primitive data type:
1. numbers : it can be integer, decimal, float, double etc.
2.  srtring : line of words
3.  boolean : true or false (1 or 0)
4.  NULL: This data type represents the absence of any value. It is represented by the keyword null(without any quotes).
5.  Undefined: This data type also represents the absence of a value, if any variable is not assigned any value, it has an undefined value. It is denoted by the keyword undefined. This is not the same as null.

* Non-primitive data type:
1. object:  An object is a collection of different types of related data. This is related to the concept of complex and custom data types.
2. Constant type: using const keyword we can define an variable as constant type.  const myConst = "Studytonight";
