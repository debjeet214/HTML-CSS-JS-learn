Just like the var keyword, we can also create variables using the let keyword. 
The variables that are defined with var statement have function scope. The variables that are defined with let statement have block scope.

We can declare a variable again even if it has been defined previously in the same scope.	
We cannot declare a variable more than once if we defined that previously in the same scope.
