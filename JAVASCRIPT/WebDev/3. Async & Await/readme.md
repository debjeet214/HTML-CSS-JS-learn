await & async 

async works like combination of callbacks & promises for more better results

Adding await will make a function to be executing and as long as the function is not fully executed, the other next codes will not get executed as well.

settle = promise maybe resolved or rejected ( means executed)
resolved = promise succesfully executed with positive returns

GET requests are intended to retrieve data from a server and do not modify the server's state. On the other hand, POST requests are used to send data to the server for processing and may modify the server's state.
