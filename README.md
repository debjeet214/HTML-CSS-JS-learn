# HTML-learning *****************************************IMPORTANT
In this article, we will know HTML SVG Basics, & their implementation through examples. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It basically defines vector-based graphics in XML format. SVG graphics do NOT lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized. Every element and every attribute in SVG files can be animated.

Advantages of SVG: Advantages of using SVG over other image formats (like JPEG and GIF) are: 

SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor.
SVG images can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.
SVG images are scalable.
SVG images can be printed with high quality at any resolution.
Differences between HTML SVG and HTML Canvas:

SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML whereas Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly with JavaScript.
If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape whereas Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser.
SVG is resolution independent whereas CANVAS is resolution-dependent.
SVG supports event handlers whereas CANVAS doesnâ€™t have support for event handlers.
